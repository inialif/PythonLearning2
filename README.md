## Function
---
A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. It allows you to organize your code into reusable components, making it easier to manage and maintain. Functions can take input parameters, perform operations, and return output values.

#### ***1. Definition***
Define a function using the def keyword followed by the function name and parentheses containing any input parameter

#### ***2. Call***
Call a function by using the function name followed by parentheses. You can pass arguments to the function if it requires input parameters.

#### ***3. Return***
Use the return statement to return a value from a function. The function will terminate and return the specified value.

#### ***4. Pass by Reference vs Value***
- In Python, arguments are passed by reference, meaning the function receives a reference to the object in memory. Changes made to mutable objects (e.g., lists) within the function will affect the original object.

- Unlike mutable objects, immutable objects (e.g., integers, strings) cannot be modified in place. If you reassign an immutable object within a function, it will create a new object in memory.

## NumPy
---
- NumPy is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for multidimensional arrays, mathematical functions, and linear algebra operations. NumPy is widely used in data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing.
- To use NumPy, you need to import the library using the import numpy as np statement.
  
#### NumPy Array
A NumPy array is a grid of values with the same data type. It can be created using the np.array() function by passing a list or tuple of values.

#### Dimension in Arrays
- Dimensions in NumPy arrays refer to the number of axes or dimensions in the array. A 1D array has one axis, a 2D array has two axes, and so on. Uses ndim attribute to get the number of dimensions.

## Pandas
---
- Pandas is a popular data manipulation library built on top of NumPy. It provides data structures like Series and DataFrame, which are essential for working with structured data.
- To use Pandas, you need to import the library using the import pandas as pd statement.

### Pandas - Series
A Pandas Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding data of any type. It is similar to a NumPy array but with additional indexing capabilities. pd.Series() function is used to create a Series.

#### 1. Implicit and Explicit Indexing
By default, a Series is created with an implicit integer index starting from 0. You can specify custom labels for the index using the index parameter.
  - Explicit Indexing : Allows you to assign custom labels to the elements in a Series. You can use the index parameter to specify the index labels.
    ![image](https://github.com/inialif/PythonLearning2/assets/165395693/7f9a7f5c-e4b6-405b-b700-aaf86ce90a6c)

  - Implisit Indexing : Uses the default integer index to access elements in a Series. You can use the default index to retrieve values from the Series.

#### 2. Data Slicing
Data slicing allows you to extract a subset of data from a Series based on the index labels or positions. You can use slicing to select specific elements or ranges of elements.
- Explicit Indexing

### Pandas - DataFrame
A Pandas DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. It is similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table and is widely used for data analysis and manipulation.

#### 1. Convert Data Series to DataFrame
You can convert a Pandas Series into a DataFrame using the pd.DataFrame() function. The Series elements become the data values in the DataFrame, and the index labels become the row labels.
